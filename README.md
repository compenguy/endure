# Endure: To The End

`Endure: To The End` is being developed as a project guided by the
[14th Annual Oregon Game Project Challenge](http://www.ogpc.info).
Challenge practices/goals/guidelines can be found in the
[2020-2021 Achievement Guide](https://www.ogpc.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2021-Achievements.pdf).

Inspired by the theme, "Resilience", I decided to make a game where
you do the same thing, over and over, improving with each run-through,
keeping a speedrun leaderboard for each player.

The game mechanics borrow from the classic MMO 2D space shooter game
[SubSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubSpace_(video_game)).

# Compiling

`Endure: To The End` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
